This is the first repo I created as directed by Thinkful Bootcamp for practice

## Header 2
A good README file has...
*[a single paragraph describing the project]
*[information about the author or creator]
*[any acknowledgments, such as expressing thanks to anyone whose code you used and mentioning anyone whose work inspired you]
